# Information

The website (with hardcoded data) is available at \\silva.computing.dundee.ac.uk/webapps/2019-agileteam16/public/index.html
It should be accessed using Google Chrome as there are a few strange layout bugs in other browsers.
I think Silva is only accessible from the computing network, the website currently takes a while (up to a few mins) to load. We will speak to Mahamadou about this at the start of Sprint 2.

## Hints:

- You may wish to change the issue tags that are in GitHub to map to different activities that you are carrying out:
- Code Review
- Documentation
- Daily Scrums
- etc.
- Feel free to add in additional folders/documents that you feel will benefit your repository.
- Have a look at the gitHub documentation for advice on how to use more advanced features in GitHub to support your work
